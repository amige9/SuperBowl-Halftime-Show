# SuperBowl-Halftime-Show

# Introduction
<p>Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a></p>

## Dataset(S)
I will be working with three datasets
1. super_bowls.csv: This dataset contains details about the super bowl matches with details such as the Date of the match, Venue, Attendance, Winning teams, Losing teams, Scores etc
2. tv.csv: This dataset contains information about the network station showing the halftime shows, average usa viewers, total usa viewwers, householfd ratings, advert cost etc
3. halftime_musicians.csv: This dataset contains information such as the name of the musician who performed and at the half time show and number of songs 

## Description
I would perform a simple Data Wrangling operation on the dataset. Data collection, exploration, and minor dataset cleaning are included in this.


## Question for Analysis
1. What are the most extreme game outcomes?
2. How does the game affect television viewership?
3. How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
4. Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
